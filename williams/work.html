    <h1>I run a sports card shop at our local flea market.  I created the black and yellow logo shown above.  I  sell all kinds of collectibles.  Basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and Pokemon cards are just a few of the different items you can find here.  I buy, sell, and trade anything that can be collected.  My favorite sport is basketball.  I love meeting new people from different places and talking sports with them.  It is a very exciting job and you never know who you are going to meet and what kinds of stories you are going to hear.  You can come by and visit my shop.  The location and hours of operation are shown below.</h1>
