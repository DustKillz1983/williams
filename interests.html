        Welcome to Dusty's Interests.  I have a few things that I really enjoy doing.  I love driving around in my car and listening to music.  I also love watching scary movies.  I can't forget mentioning my little cat, Slick.  He is mean, but he is my baby.  I also love learning new things and that is why I am taking this course.  I already have a Bachelor's Degree, but I want to continue learning about different things.  I always wanted to know more about how a website is created, so here I am.

        <p>These are a few of my favorite restaurants.  We have the Olive Garden, which is italian. Their salads are one of their signature dishes, which come with endless breadsticks.  I always have cheese ravioli as my entree.  Then we have a couple of excellent steak houses. Rafferty's and Columbia's are two of the best steak houses around Kentucky and I would reccomend to anyone around here to try them out. I think there are many Rafferty's locations across the United States, but Columbia's is exclusive to the Lexington area.</p>

        <p>I started golfing at around age 12 and played a lot throughout middle and high school, but since then have not played much. But that does not make me love the sport any less.  I enjoy it because it is a relaxing and social, yet challenging and strategic game.  I have played at several nice courses around the area.  <a href=http://www.weissingerhills.com>Weissinger Hills Golf Course</a> is very nice, especially if you are looking for a long course.</p>

        <p>Linkin Park came on the scene when I was in high school. I had just purchased my first car, a red Toyota Celica, which I equipped with three 10" subs and a very nice amp.  You can't even imagine the sound that this audio system produced! It was incredible! Rap and hip-hop songs, which put out the most bass, was what this system was designed for and it sounded great. I remember, specifically, bumping Nelly as my friends and I were approaching the school parking lot in the mornings. Even though I really did appreciate rap, my most favorite music genre was rock, pop-rock, or alternative.  During that time, and up until recent years, there was nobody better the Linkin Park, or LP for short.  I remember the song, "Crawling" as one of their most famous first releases.  LP rocked! Nobody was better at rocking a crowd than them. And they continued to be the best of rock up until a few years ago when their lead singer, Chester Bennington, commited suicide. I absolutely loved their music so this was very sad for me, and what hurt me worse was that I had never seen them in concert.  They have just, in the last year, attempted to replace him in the band, wich didn't sound terrible, but the could never be as good as they were with him.  Here are a few pictures of them as they were a very big interest of mine over the years and a big inspiration! </p>

        <p>Another great interest of mine is traveling!  Their are so many place I would love to see in this lifetime. In this section I will eventually attempt to add pages and links to different places I have been to or want to go to. For now, I will just talk a little about the places that I have been to.</p>
        <p>Within the United States, I have mostly traveled over the southeast states.</p>

    <p>The University of Kentucky Wildcats are an excellent team and most favorite basketball team.  They just got kicked out of the March Madness Tournament last night which was depressing, but we will try again next year. They have won the tournament several times over the years so they are a team that stands out to many.  The Louisville Cardinals are also a well-known team here in Kentucky.  I also root for them but they are not my favorite. Also, I attended University of Kentucky College which was a great experience.</p>
