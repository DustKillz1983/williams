        Welcome to Dusty's Interests.  I have a few things that I really enjoy doing.  I love driving around in my car and listening to music.  I also love watching scary movies.  I can't forget mentioning my little cat, Slick.  He is mean, but he is my baby.  I also love learning new things and that is why I am taking this course.  I already have a Bachelor's Degree, but I want to continue learning about different things.  I always wanted to know more about how a website is created, so here I am.
