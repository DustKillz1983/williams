       Welcome to Dusty's Site!  I am currently taking some web design courses through Coursera's online learning program.  So far I am really enjoying it.  This site is a result of from what I am learning there.  At the beginning I only knew some basic HTML, but now I have graduated on to CSS which I would like to think I am fairly proficient with.  My next course is going to be exploring Javascript which I am excited about.  I know nothing about it at the moment but as I learn over the duration of the course I will be applying it in real time to this site!
       <br>
       <br>
       Now that you know why I am creating this site, let me tell you what it is about.  The site is all about me.  It is going to be a type of journal which is going to include my interests, my work, where I live, and anything else that I feel like sharing. I am going to include a section on my vacations, my hobbies, and just things I am excited about.
       <br>
       <br>
       As I learn more about web design I will be incorporating it here.  Hopefully, I will be adding elements like images, audio, video, forms, navigation, and animations.  I am not really sure who my audience for this site will be, if anyone at all besides me, but I am excited to see it develop.
       <br>

       I am putting a lot of time into my vacation's page.  I've had several really great vacations to mention and document. I've been to Gatlinburg, TN, Biltmore Mansion in Asheville, NC, Amsterdam, and Florida.  I have also been to London and Paris but that was before the age of digital cameras and iPhones so I will have to scan some of those pictures in later.  I am excited to share these experiences with you.  Check out my vaycays right here.....<br>

       If you want to email me, please click the button below.  I am learning how to create these right now so this is an excellent example and I must say it looks quite nice.  Hopefully, I will learn how to create forms in the near future so we can look forward to that.
