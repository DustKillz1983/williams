            Welcome to my house.  I live in Shelbyville, Kentucky.  I have always been a resident of Shelbyville, but this particular house since 2002.  I love it here!  We have about five acres out in the country.  As you can see from the photographs, we get a decent amount of snow in the winter time.  This is great for me because I am a big snow lover. We only experience the snow for around two months of the year, so it comes and goes fairly quickly.  The summer weather here is really nice as well with temperatures in the 80s and 90s.  The guy in the middle picture is my best friend, Jared.  He was visiting from Montana when this picture was taken.  Since they get a lot of snow in Montana, he felt right at home here.  He was all about shoveling the snow so we put him to work.

        Here are some pictures from last summer.  I just wanted everyone to see that it is also sunny and warm here too.
