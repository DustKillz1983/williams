        This is my house.  I live in Shelbyville, Kentucky.  I have lived here for about 10 years.  I love my house and I love the area.  I have a big back yard and a big front yard.  I have a big deck on the back of my house and I love to sit out there and watch the birds and the squirrels.  I also have a big front porch where I can sit and watch the cars go by.  I love my house and I love my neighborhood.

        Here is my house in the midst of a snow storm.  I love the snow and I snapped this picture a few weeks ago when we had a lot of it.  I am in Shelbyville, Kentucky.
