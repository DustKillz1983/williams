    <p>Welcome to the Shelby County Flea Market!  I rent a booth here where I run a sports card shop.  I call this place, Dusty's Card Shop! You can see below the awesome logo I created.  The logo colors are black and yellow and I think it turned out pretty great.  Dusty's Card Shop, or DCS for short, sells all sorts of collectibles. DCS isn't just cards, even though basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and Pokemon cards are my biggest sellers.  DCS also sells pogs, antique bottles, Beanie Babies, puzzles, books, and old video games.  I have also been known to buy and trade if I am in the mood.</p>

         I always have a great time at the shop.  It's not just about making a little extra money. I meet new and interesting people every weekend.  I am always excited to hear stories about how collectors have attained different collectibles over their years.  You never know who you will meet and learn about.  And you never know what kinds of collected treasures you will come accross.
