<p>Another one of my passions is collecting things.  I love to collect all types of cards, from basketball to Pokemon.   Basketball cards are probably my most favorite item to collect.  I know almost all of the NBA players right now and through running the card shop I am learning much more.  I still don't know how to play football, but I am starting to grasp all of the player's names.  I have a nice collection of basketball, football, and baseball cards and I am working on other sports like soccer.  I also sell a lot of Pokemon cards at the shop so I am trying to learn all I can about those as well.  I will post my favorite cards and other collectibles on here for all to see!</p>
