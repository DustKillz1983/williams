        <h1>My Investment Portfolio</h1>

    <p>

        One of my favorite things to do is to dabble in the stock market.  I have been using the Stash application for several years now and I have made a few great investments.  Until the recent crash of the market I had profited more than $900!  That was a great return considering how much I had invested.  I would like to talk a little about my investment strategies and what companies I currently own stock in.  I once aspired to be an investment banker or something in that field so this is one of my passions.

        I would like to use this page as a place to display and document all of the companies that I have stock in.  There are so many of them that it will take a while for me to add all of them.  Since everything has been bottoming out over the past couple of weeks I decided to make some small investments in many companies.  I just felt that, at these low stock prices, I could not resist.  I only made $5 investments in many companies but at the least this will make it easy for me to follow all of these companies through the Stash app.  Let me know of any insider trading that is going on in the stock market world.  I am always ready to jump on a good investment!
