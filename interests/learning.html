    One of my favorite things to do is to learn new things.  I have always been a curious person and I love to learn about new things.  I have a passion for history and I love to learn about the past.  I also love to learn about new technologies and how they work.  I have always been a hands on learner and I love to take things apart and put them back together.  I have a passion for learning and I hope to continue to learn new things for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>I am going to use this page as a place to display all of my educational accomplishments.  Also, I would like to add my different dream jobs and why I am interested in them.  Hopefully some high ranking individual from Google or Amazon will come across this page and realize what a great fit I would be for some very high paying job. That would be awesome!
