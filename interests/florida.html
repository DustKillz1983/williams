       <h1>My Vacation to Florida</h1>
    </header>
    <p>

    In 2024, we went on a well-deserved, over due vacations to Florida.  My parents and I hadn't been on a vacation in decades so we were very excited to go.  We went the week of my birthday and had a great time.  We stayed at the beach for a couple of nights.  It was incredible!  Our hotel room had an oceanfront balcony where we watched and listened to the waves roll in.  We would have enjoyed staying there longer, but we had already booked another room in Orlando that was close to our next destination, Disney World and Universal Studios.  <br><br>
    Disney World was amazing!  It is split into several different parks and we had already visited the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood Studios before so we settled on the Animal Kingdom.  There, we experienced a wildlife safari and The World of Avatar. Also, my dad and I fought the rapids on the Kali River Rapids ride.  I wasn't that impressed with it.  We only barely got wet.  After that, I rode a roller coaster called Expedition Everest.  It was a blast!  I loved it!  My parents were not down to get on any roller coasters so I did this one solo.  The line was not long and the ride duration was moderate.  One part of the ride was intense.  It appeared as if the track was broken and the train was going to fall off the track.  It was a great illusion.  I would definitely ride it again.<br><br>
    Universal Studios was also a cool place.  It was also broken into several different parks.  This was another way to extort more cash from the customer.  Parts of Universal were very interesting and exciting, but I just wouldn't rank it as high as Disney World.  The best part was The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  They recreated in unbelievable detail the town of Hogsmeade.  I wouldn't have been surprised to run into Harry as I was walking through.  Of course, I had to stop into the wand shop and purchase a wand just like Harry's.  they did have some other cool rides as well.  My dad and I rode Revenge of the Mummy which was pretty intense.  I made my dad sick which was a downer.  Then mom and I rode Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.  I would kind of silly.  It was a 3D motion simulator ride.  Last, the Men In Black ride was interesting.  As you rode around through an alien infested city, every rider was equipped with a laser gun to fend off the aliens and earn points.  I wasn't sure if it was just my gun or everyone's gun, but I could never tell if I was shooting acurately.  There was a screen in front of you that showed your score, but I couldn't tell if I was hitting the targets or not.  I almost forgot to mention the other motion simulator ride, Jimmy Fallon in New York.  I'm not sure if this is even worth mentioning.  It was mildly fun.  How could you turn a late night talk show into a motion simulator?  I will never know. I will have to say "Just Dumb".<br><br>
